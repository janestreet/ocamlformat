(* This comment moves for similar reason to existing behavior as shown below.
   In particular, the operator ([@@] / [->]) does not carry a source locaion,
   and the comment attaches to the location of the identifier on the right
   side of the operator rather than the left due to the parenthesis. Fixing
   this would require messing with the comment association logic, which is
   difficult. *)

(* This comment attaches to the [f]; the syntax [(f @ mode1)] doesn't have
   its own location to latch onto. This seems like a rare position to put a
   comment, so it doesn't seem worth changing the parser to be able to
   differentiate the following two. *)
