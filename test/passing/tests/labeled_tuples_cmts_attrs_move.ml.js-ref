(* Tests making sure comments and attributes are handled reasonably by labeled tuple
   printing.  This test has where we allow ourselves to slightly move a comment or add a
   pun or parens that aren't strictly necessary.  These examples are all analagous to
   similar cases with other forms (e.g., labeled arguments).  See
   [labeled_tuples_cmts_attrs.ml] for examples that stay exactly the same after
   formatting. *)

(* Attrs around expressions *)
let y = ~z, (z [@attr])
let y = ~z, ~z [@@attr]
let y = ~z:((42 [@attr]) : int), 42

(* Comments around expressions *)
let _ = (* baz *) ~z, ~(y : int)
let _ = ~z, ~(* baz *) (y : int)
let _ = ~z, ~(y : int) (* baz *)

(* Attrs around types *)
type t = (z:int * y:bool[@attr])

(* Comments around patterns *)
let (* baz *) ~z, ~y = ()
let ~z, (* baz *) ~y = ()
let ~z:42, ~((* baz *) y : int) = ()
let ~z:42, ~((* baz *) y : int) = ()
let ~z:42, ~(y : int) (* baz *) = ()
